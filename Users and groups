Users and Groups

User groups play an important role on Linux systems. They provide an easy way for a select groups of users to share files with each other.
They also allow sysadmins to more effectively manage user privileges, since they can assign privileges to groups rather than individual users.

1. Groups
In Linux, a group is a collection of users.
The main purpose of the groups is to define a set of privileges like read, write, or execute permission for a given resource that can be shared among the users within the group. 
Users can be added to an existing group to utilize the privileges it grants.
In Linux there are two types of group; primary group and secondary group.

A.Primary group 
Primary group is also known as private group. Primary group is compulsory. 
Every user must be a member of a primary group and there can be only one primary group for each member.

B.Secondary group
Secondary groups are those that users might be added to once they already have accounts. Secondary group memberships show up in the /etc/group file.
The /etc/group file assigns names to user groups (e.g., 500 = devops) and records secondary group members.

2.Users
A user is an entity, in a Linux operating system, that can manipulate files and perform several other operations.
Each user is assigned an ID that is unique for each user in the operating system. 
In this post, we will learn about users and commands which are used to get information about the users.

A.Sudo user
The sudo command allows you to run programs with the security privileges of another user (by default, as the superuser). 



3.Commands :

su:switch user
adduser: add a user to the system.
userdel: delete a user account and related files.
addgroup: add a group to the system.
delgroup: remove a group from the system.
usermod: modify a user account.
chage: change user password expiry information.
sudo: run one or more commands as another user (typically with superuser permissions).
cat:viewing content of the file.
