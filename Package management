1. Package Management:

Package management is a method of installing and maintaining (which includes updating and probably removing as well) software on the system.

In the early days of Linux, programs were only distributed as source code, along with the required man pages, the necessary configuration files, and more. 
Nowadays, most Linux distributors use by default pre-built programs or sets of programs called packages, which are presented to users ready for installation on that distribution.
However, one of the wonders of Linux is still the possibility to obtain source code of a program to be studied, improved, and compiled.
